# Factorial challenge:

Remember factorials from high school? The factorial “!” operator means that you should multiply a number by all the whole numbers that come before the number. So, 4! is equal to 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, or 24.

Create a function that accepts an integer as input and calculates the factorial of that number. If the number is 4, then the output should be 24.

Looking for more of a challenge? Try validating the user input. If a number is less than zero, then display a message that says, “Input cannot be negative.” If the input is 0, then the output should be 1.
