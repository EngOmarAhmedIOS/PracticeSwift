##  Isograms
An isogram is a word that has no repeated letters. For example, “today” is an isogram, but “tomorrow” is not. Create a function that accepts an input string and returns TRUE if the word is an isogram and FALSE if the word is not.

As an added challenge, if the word is an isogram, output the repeated letter or letters instead of outputting TRUE. So, an input of “tomorrow” would output [“o”, “r”].
